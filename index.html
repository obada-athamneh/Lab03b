                <article>NASA was established in 1958, succeeding the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics
                    (NACA). The new agency was to have a distinctly civilian orientation, encouraging peaceful
                    applications in space science.[7][8][9] Since its establishment, most US space exploration efforts
                    have been led by NASA, including the Apollo Moon landing missions, the Skylab space station, and
                    later the Space Shuttle. NASA is supporting the International Space Station and is overseeing the
                    development of the Orion spacecraft, the Space Launch System, and Commercial Crew vehicles. The
                    agency is also responsible for the Launch Services Program, which provides oversight of launch
                    operations and countdown management for uncrewed NASA launches.

                <article>Space Exploration Technologies Corp. (SpaceX) is an American aerospace manufacturer and space
                    transportation services company headquartered in Hawthorne, California. It was founded in 2002 by
                    Elon Musk with the goal of reducing space transportation costs to enable the colonization of
                    Mars.[9][10][11] SpaceX has developed several launch vehicles, as well as the Dragon cargo
                    spacecraft and the Starlink satellite constellation (providing internet access), and has flown
                    humans to the International Space Station on the SpaceX Dragon 2. </article>
